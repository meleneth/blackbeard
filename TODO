known crashes:
    resize window can die if it happens to hit inside select()
    crashes trying to write job status file because no filename
    crashes on certain postsets when displayed on postsetlist screen

Needs to do:
    keep up to date with headers in newsgroups, expire old ones and the postsets that had them
    store list of active jobs in file
    be able to retrieve headers as first thing if postset job doesn't have all the message id's
    make indicators work
    *   k/sec
        gigs downloaded
    load previous jobs at startup
    fix yEnc decoder to be able to download further pieces if one piece missing - fseek problem not going past EOF
    silence logs, info should be user-useful.
    handle more msg ids coming in for a postset we have marked for retrieval -- doesn't this work automagically?  I think it does
    * be able to mark individual files from a postset for retrieval
    be able to retrieve multiple files from a postset simultainiously
    implement new template base class for jobs that have sub-jobs
    allow multi line status
    skip PAR2's
    save file info for postsets, not just postset
    fix displays
        postset detail doesn't update display of files as they come in
        postset detail doesn't show actual status of downloading files

Decoders:
    Implement UUDecoder
*   Implement yEnc Decoder
    Implement MIME Decoder
    Optimize Decoders

Pattern matching:
    --
*    I want to be able to do this:
*
*    StringSplitter *splitter = new Stringsplitter();
*    splitter << "(" << FILE_NUM << ")" << OTHER_TEXT;
*
*    and have it be able to handle the parsing from there.
    --

    load patterns from config file

Interface:
*   need to be able to use arrow keys to flip between PostSets
*   need to be able to mark PostSet for retrieval
*   show pieces of the file queue instead of the big log
    have small log window, with scrollback
*   only allow typing when you're on the log window
*   typing is sending commands to system, not directly interupting TCP streams
*   tab to switch panes
*   progress bar for postset downloads (brian)
*   multiple newsgroups
*   allow views of like panes - 
*       newsgroups
*       postsets
*   allow search - 
*       newsgroups
*       postsets
*   browse all newsgroups
    
General:
    Add ability to check cross-posted groups for missing pieces
*   Add resize support (ncurses)
*   Add net jobs
*   Add decoder jobs
    Save memory by stripping information for postsets we're not particularly interested into postset name, and min/max message_id for easy recreation with a targetted xover
    Persistence:
*       newsgroups
*       postsets
        jobs
