What to Do Next:
make PostsetJob queue jobs for all of it's non par files
have it trigger when done

remove entire ncurses interface
* make javascript make tables, not lists 
* allow web interface to grab headers / queue downloads

use SQLite for data store. <- huge change
    one db file per newsgroup
    store all message ID's
    store postsets
    store files
    maintain current save strategy, i.e. don't use sqlite except for startup and shutdown

Much excitement over new web interface.

Needs to handle par2's inline. <- important

tag removal in subjects (too much of a mess still) strip () [] and scan postsets within groups
    for tags.  Store known tags for a group on the newsgroup, and modify the sanitize function to remove them
    when looking up postsets.

Web enhancements:
    Ability to queue
    Abillity to download
    Hover-view: when mouseover a postset line, grab info from server and display in mini-div
    auto-grab postset range when user clicks on postset if we don't have the whole range already

known crashes:
    * resize window can die if it happens to hit inside select() -> seems to be fixed, wouldn't know how
    crashes on certain postset stats when displayed on postsetlist screen - usually when loading
    crashes on certain postsets when displayed on postsetlist screen
    net jobs crash when they get cleared sometimes
    needs to handle net errors due to i.e. message ID not being available - has bad response code

Web API:
    /joblist
    /newsgroups
    /postsets/news.group.name
    /postfiles/news.group.name,post_set_index

Needs to do:
    * investigate not resizing.  Is it only under gdb? <- yes, it is.  As far as I can tell.
    store a list of previous downloads, browsable and be able to go to the postset detail by hitting enter on the list
    percentages for header retrieval jobs
    * store list of active jobs in file
    * be able to retrieve headers as first thing if postset job doesn't have all the message id's
    keep up to date with headers in subscribed newsgroups, expire old ones and the postsets that had them
        - kinda works, but doesn't happen automatically
        after a postsetjob is done, add a new newsgroupping job
    * make indicators work
    *   k/sec
        gigs downloaded
    * load previous jobs at startup
    Save memory by stripping information for postsets we're not particularly interested into postset name, and min/max message_id for easy recreation with a targetted xover
    have small log window, with scrollback
    shorten info on post set detail - dont need XX/XX seen pieces
    be able to view .nfo files
    additional status line on post set list screen, showing tags 
        [nfo] = has .nfo file 
        [sfv] = has .sfv file
        [par2] = has .par2 file(s)
        [broken] = has corrupt pieces
        [fixable] = has corrupt pieces, and par2's.  will try to grab par files as well


    silence logs, info should be user-useful.
    handle more msg ids coming in for a postset we have marked for retrieval -- doesn't this work automagically?  I think it does
    * be able to mark individual files from a postset for retrieval
    be able to retrieve multiple files from a postset simultainiously
    implement new template base class for jobs that have sub-jobs
    allow multi line status
*   skip PAR2's
    <Cancelled> save file info for postsets, not just postset
    fix displays
        * postset detail doesn't update display of files as they come in
        * postset detail doesn't show actual status of downloading files

Decoders:
    Implement UUDecoder
*   Implement yEnc Decoder
    Implement MIME Decoder
    Optimize Decoders

*Pattern matching:
*    --
*    I want to be able to do this:
*
*    StringSplitter *splitter = new Stringsplitter();
*    splitter << "(" << FILE_NUM << ")" << OTHER_TEXT;
*
*    and have it be able to handle the parsing from there.

*   fix yEnc decoder to be able to download further pieces if one piece missing - fseek problem not going past EOF

Interface:
*   need to be able to use arrow keys to flip between PostSets
*   need to be able to mark PostSet for retrieval
*   show pieces of the file queue instead of the big log
*   only allow typing when you're on the log window
*   typing is sending commands to system, not directly interupting TCP streams
*   tab to switch panes
*   progress bar for postset downloads (brian)
*   multiple newsgroups
*   allow views of like panes - 
*       newsgroups
*       postsets
*   allow search - 
*       newsgroups
*       postsets
*   browse all newsgroups
    
General:
    Add ability to check cross-posted groups for missing pieces
*   Add resize support (ncurses)
*   Add net jobs
*   Add decoder jobs
    Persistence:
*       newsgroups
*       postsets
*       jobs
