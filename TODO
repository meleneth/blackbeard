Decoders:
    Implement UUDecoder
*   Implement yEnc Decoder
    Implement MIME Decoder
    Optimize Decoders


Threads:
    multiple net threads
*   console render thread
*   input thread
*   main() waiting for thread_join
*   file decoder thread 
*   locking <- only needed in job control for the job list and 
               file decode to only mmap the file once (I think)


Pattern matching:
    --
*    I want to be able to do this:
*
*    StringSplitter *splitter = new Stringsplitter();
*    splitter << "(" << FILE_NUM << ")" << OTHER_TEXT;
*
*    and have it be able to handle the parsing from there.

    load patterns from config file

Interface:
*   need to be able to use arrow keys to flip between PostSets
    need to be able to mark PostSet for retrieval
    show pieces of the file queue instead of the big log
    have small log window, with scrollback
*   only allow typing when you're on the log window
*   typing is sending commands to system, not directly interupting TCP streams
*   tab to switch panes
*   progress bar for postset downloads (brian)
*   multiple newsgroups
*   allow views of like panes - 
*       newsgroups
*       postsets
    allow search - 
*       newsgroups
*       postsets
*   browse all newsgroups
    
General:
    Add ability to check cross-posted groups for missing pieces
*   Add resize support (ncurses)
    Add net jobs
*   Add decoder jobs
    Save memory by stripping information for postsets we're not particularly interested into postset name, and min/max message_id for easy recreation with a targetted xover
    Persistence:
*       newsgroups
        postsets
        jobs
