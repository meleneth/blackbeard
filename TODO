known crashes:
    * resize window can die if it happens to hit inside select() -> seems to be fixed, wouldn't know how
    crashes on certain postset stats when displayed on postsetlist screen - usually when loading
    crashes on certain postsets when displayed on postsetlist screen
    net jobs crash when they get cleared sometimes
    needs to handle net errors due to i.e. message ID not being available - has bad response code

Needs to do:
    * store list of active jobs in file
    * be able to retrieve headers as first thing if postset job doesn't have all the message id's
    keep up to date with headers in subscribed newsgroups, expire old ones and the postsets that had them
        after a postsetjob is done, add a new newsgroupping job
    * make indicators work
    *   k/sec
        gigs downloaded
    * load previous jobs at startup
    Save memory by stripping information for postsets we're not particularly interested into postset name, and min/max message_id for easy recreation with a targetted xover
    have small log window, with scrollback
    shorten info on post set detail - dont need XX/XX seen pieces
    be able to view .nfo files

    silence logs, info should be user-useful.
    handle more msg ids coming in for a postset we have marked for retrieval -- doesn't this work automagically?  I think it does
    * be able to mark individual files from a postset for retrieval
    be able to retrieve multiple files from a postset simultainiously
    implement new template base class for jobs that have sub-jobs
    allow multi line status
*   skip PAR2's
    <Cancelled> save file info for postsets, not just postset
    fix displays
        * postset detail doesn't update display of files as they come in
        * postset detail doesn't show actual status of downloading files

Decoders:
    Implement UUDecoder
*   Implement yEnc Decoder
    Implement MIME Decoder
    Optimize Decoders

*Pattern matching:
*    --
*    I want to be able to do this:
*
*    StringSplitter *splitter = new Stringsplitter();
*    splitter << "(" << FILE_NUM << ")" << OTHER_TEXT;
*
*    and have it be able to handle the parsing from there.

*   fix yEnc decoder to be able to download further pieces if one piece missing - fseek problem not going past EOF

Interface:
*   need to be able to use arrow keys to flip between PostSets
*   need to be able to mark PostSet for retrieval
*   show pieces of the file queue instead of the big log
*   only allow typing when you're on the log window
*   typing is sending commands to system, not directly interupting TCP streams
*   tab to switch panes
*   progress bar for postset downloads (brian)
*   multiple newsgroups
*   allow views of like panes - 
*       newsgroups
*       postsets
*   allow search - 
*       newsgroups
*       postsets
*   browse all newsgroups
    
General:
    Add ability to check cross-posted groups for missing pieces
*   Add resize support (ncurses)
*   Add net jobs
*   Add decoder jobs
    Persistence:
*       newsgroups
*       postsets
*       jobs
