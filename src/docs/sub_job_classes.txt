Jobs need:
ability to create / register sub-jobs <- so PostSetJob can have PostFileJobs that can have BodyRetriever and Decoder jobs
netcentral / jobqueue split still needed
jobs get parent, which is their hook back into who owns them
ability to handle a command that failed -> connections hang currently when a msg id cannot be retrieved

how to handle net connections better:
postset jobs and file jobs lose their network connections, which leave only bodyretriver and headerretriever jobs that need net connection

how do I put postset / file jobs on the main queue?

newsgroups need live_min_id live_max_id for what ranges we have xover'd in this run.  Individual postset downloads do not affect this, unless they overlap the range

"shake the tree" style - postset queues a file's worth of messages, file queues all message id's for that file..
  -- would this be easier with a third job queue?  for the Orchard?  (har)
  -- header job should queue range jobs 
  -- new range stuff means postset->has_msg_ids should change to reflect the retrieved headers this session
  -- since restore file is so small anyways it might make sense to store file info as well

job priority - interactive jobs should get a connection ASAP.  This can be faked by pushing to the front of the list (?)
